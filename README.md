# Full Fat Monads

An experimental replacement for DRY monads that attempts to:

  - reduce implementation complexity
  - provide a more idiomatic FP usage experience
  - provide more functionality

## How to do various things

### Tests

To run the tests once
`bundle exec rspec`

To watch the directories and run the tests after changes
`bundle exec guard`

### Lint

To run the rubocop linter
`bundle exec rubocop`

To automatically fix linting warnings (warning: not always safe)
`bundle exec rubocop -A`

### Documentation

To generate the documentation
`yard doc`

To display how bad I am at writing documentation

`yard stats`
